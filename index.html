        <p>In 2020, over 250,000 people died from brain and Central Nervous System (CNS)
            tumors. Brain tumors account for around 85% or more of these. As of 2021, over
            16 million people in the United States have been diagnosed with some type of
            cognitive impairment. The goal of this paper is to find the most effective set of
            data augmentations to correctly classify cognitive diseases with deep networks,
            using structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data. This paper demonstrates a Greedy optimization technique to find the most effective sequence of
            data augmentations out of blurring, distortion, position, and red noise (an overlay
            augmentation displaying random clouds of noise on the images). We sought to
            classify three tumors: glioma tumors, pituitary tumors, and meningioma tumors,
            as well as detect if there was no tumor at all. We also classified three stages of
            Alzheimerâ€™s disease: not demented, very mildly demented, and mildly demented,
            to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the data augmentation sequence.</p>
